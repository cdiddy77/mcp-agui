# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a new project called `mcp-agui` that is currently in its initial stage with minimal setup. The repository has just been initialized with a basic README.md file.

## Project Status

- **Current State**: Newly initialized repository
- **Main Branch**: main
- **Initial Commit**: "first commit" (7dcce13)

## Development Notes

Since this is a newly initialized project with no existing codebase, build system, or dependencies:

1. When asked to implement features, first establish the project type and technology stack with the user
2. Set up appropriate build tools, package management, and project structure based on the chosen technology
3. Create necessary configuration files (package.json, tsconfig.json, etc.) as needed
4. Establish coding conventions and patterns as the first code is written

## Next Steps

When working in this repository, you should:
- Ask the user about the intended purpose and technology stack for the project
- Set up the appropriate project structure based on the project type
- Initialize the necessary build and dependency management tools
- Create initial source code directories and configuration files as needed
